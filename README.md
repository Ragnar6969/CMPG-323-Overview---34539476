# Branching Strategy
The branching strategy will consist of 3 branches: Main, Develop and Hotfix. I will use the Develop branch to make changes and when I am satisfied with the changes I will commit and merge the changes to the main branch. If an error occurs, I will use the hotfix branch to quickly fix them.

# .gitignore
The .gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo.

# Credentials and Sensitive Information
The storage of credentials and sensitive information will be done in the local repository. I will use a gitignore to exempt these files from being commited, thus improving the security of credentials and sensitive information.
